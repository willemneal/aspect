## Philosophy

Testing is the first step of every project and you have a responsibility to
make sure that the software you write works as intended. The `as-pect` project
was created to help quickly scaffold and bootstrap AssemblyScript tests so
that you can be confident in yourself and the software you write.

One of the goals of this project is 100% portability to `jest` so that tests
can be run in two different environments.

## Usage

To install `as-pect`, install the latest version from github.

```
$ npm install @as-pect/core
```

To create a `TestContext` simply import it and instantiate it.

```ts
import { TestContext, EmptyReporter } from "@as-pect/core";
import { instantiateBuffer } from "assemblyscript/lib/loader";

const ctx = new TestContext({
  fileName: "test.spec.ts", // put the name of the AssemblyScript file here
  // groupRegex: /./, // if you want to filter what groups run, modify this regex
  // testRegex: /./, // if you want to filter what tests run, modify this regex
  // performanceConfiguration: {}, // modify the performance configuration here
  // nortrace: true, // disable rtrace monitoring
  // stdout: null, // change stdout (must have a `write(input: string)` method)
  // stderr: null, // change stderr (must have a `write(input: string)` method)
});

const imports = ctx.createImports({
  // put any imports here
})

// instantiate the module using instantiateStreaming or instantiateBuffer
const wasm = await instantiateStreaming(fetch("./path/to/test/binary.wasm"), imports);

// run the tests
ctx.run(wasm);

// inspect the testGroups for errors
const groups = ctx.testGroups;

// check if the tests passed
const pass = ctx.pass;
```

## Comparisons

There are a set of comparison functions defined in the `types/as-pect.d.ts` types
definition. These comparison functions allow you to inspect object and memory
state.

### toBe Comparison

This comparison is used for comparing data using the `==` operator. In
AssemblyScript this operator is used for comparing strings, numbers, and exact
reference equality (or pointer comparison.)

For example, the following statements are valid `toBe` assertions:

```ts
let a = new Vec3(1, 2, 3);
expect<Vec3>(a).toBe(a);
expect<i32>(10).toBe(10);
expect<Vec3>(null).toBe(null);
```

This method is safe to use portably with `jest`.

### toStrictEqual Comparison

This method performs a single `memory.compare()` on two blocks of data. This is
useful for references and strings. For example, using a `toBe()` assertion on
two different references results in a failed assertion:

```ts
let a = new Vec3(1, 2, 3);
let b = new Vec3(1, 2, 3);
expect<Vec3>(a).toBe(b); // fails!
```

Instead, it's posible to compare two different references like this:

```ts
expect<Vec3>(a).toStrictEqual(b); // passes!
```

The following snippet an approximate the JavaScript equivalent for the
`toStrictEqual` comparison:

```ts
// loop over each property (properties are the same at compile time)
for (let prop in a) {
  if (a[prop] === b[prop]) {
    // exact equality check
    continue;
  } else {
    assert(negated);
  }
}
assert(!negated);
```

If the object has child references, like strings or pointers to other blocks
of memory, the comparison will fail because the pointers are different. This
happens because `as-pect` cannot perform object traversal. Instead, a custom
method should be used to traverse child references to compare equality.

The `toStrictEqual` comparison, however, does perform a `==` comparison before
opting into using a full memory comparison. If the `@operator("==")` is
overridden, then it's possible for two references to be compared using this
method:

```ts
class Vec3 {
  constructor(public a: f64 = 0.0, public b: f64 = 0.0, public c: f64 = 0.0) {}

  // override the operator
  @operator("==")
  protected __equals(ref: Vec3): bool {
    return this.a == ref.a && this.b == ref.b && this.c == ref.c;
  }
}
```

This method is _not_ safe to use portably with `jest` yet. Once `Reflection`
is supported by AssemblyScript, `as-pect` will support compatibility
between `jest`'s version of this function.

### toBlockEqual Comparison

This comparison is the same comparison used on `ArrayBuffer` and `String`s.
It compares the bytes of the heap allocations by obtaining the exact size
of the block and then performing a memcompare if the `actual` and `expected`
blocks match.

Only use this comparison when comparing `ArrayBuffer` references.

```ts
let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(100); // 100 bytes long heap allocation
let buffer2 = new ArrayBuffer(100); // another buffer

expect<ArrayBuffer>(buffer).toBlockEqual(buffer2);
```

### toBeTruthy and toBeFalsy Comparison

These comparisons are used to determine if a value is truthy or falsy in the
JavaScript sense. In JavaScript there are only six falsy values:

- `false`
- `0`
- `""`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `NaN`

In AssemblyScript, there is no `undefined`, so `as-pect` will treat each of
those values as falsy. Truthy values are anything that is not falsy,

```ts
expect<bool>(true).toBeTruthy();
expect<Vec3>(new Vec3(1, 2, 3)).toBeTruthy();
expect<i32>(1).toBeTruthy();
expect<string>("Something!").toBeTruthy();
expect<bool>(false).toBeFalsy();
expect<Vec3>(null).toBeFalsy();
expect<i32>(0).toBeFalsy();
expect<f64>(NaN).toBeFalsy();
expect<string>("").toBeFalsy();
```

These methods are safe to use with `jest`.

### toBeNaN Comparison

This comparison is only used for float values to determine if the value is a
`NaN` value.

```ts
expect<f32>(NaN).toBeNaN(); // passes
expect<f64>(1.0).not.toBeNaN(); // passes

/** This results in a runtime error, despite not being NaN. */
expect<Vec3>(new Vec3()).not.toBeNaN();
```

This method is technically safe to use with `jest` with the assumption
that `as-pect` will fail if used with a reference type.

### toBeNull Comparison

This comparison looks specifically for a `null` value.

```ts
expect<Vec3>(null).toBeNull(); // valid assertion
```

In the case of numeric values, numbers cannot be `null` in AssemblyScript.
Thus, the following example will throw a runtime error.

```ts
expect<i32>(null).toBeNull();
```

This method is safe to use with `jest` assuming you explicitly return `null`
and avoid use of `undefined` which does not exist in AssemblyScript.

### toBeFinite Comparison

This comparison is used to detect if float values are finite. The following
values are not finite in JavaScript or AssemblyScript.

- `Infinity`
- `-Infinity`
- `NaN`

The following assertions are true.

```ts
expect<f64>(1.0).toBeFinite();
expect<f32>(Infinity).not.toBeFinite();
expect<f64>(NaN).not.toBeFinite();
```

As long as the number values are always `f32` or `f64` (or `number` in
JavaScript or AssemblyScript,) `toBeFinite` is a safe assertion to use
portably with jest.

### toThrow Comparison

This comparison is used to test and see if a function throws an error. In the
case of AssemblyScript and `as-pect`, the function will be called from within
a JavaScript `try` block, and if the function throws, the assertion is valid,
unless it is negated with the `not` property.

```ts
expect<() => void>(() => {
  throw new Error("Whoops!");
}).toThrow(); // valid assertion

// alternative shorter convenience syntax
expectFn(() => {
  throw new Error("Whoops!");
}).toThrow();
```

Closure is not supported in AssemblyScript yet. Also, any references that are
left dangling on the stack will hang around un`__release()`ed by
AssemblyScript.

This function is safe to use with `jest`.

### toBeGreaterThan and toBeLessThan Comparison

This set of comparisons validate that a value is greater than, less than, or
equal to another value. The following assertions are true.

```ts
expect<i32>(100).toBeGreaterThan(42);
expect<i32>(0).toBeLessThan(100);
expect<i32>(0).not.toBeGreaterThan(100);
expect<f64>(1.0).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1.0);
expect<f64>(1.0).not.toBeLessThanOrEqual(0);
```

These assertions also work with reference types when the
`@operator(">" | "<" | ">=" | "<=")` is used on a method in the class.

```ts
class Vec3 {
  constructor(public x: f64 = 0.0, public y: f64 = 0.0, public z: f64 = 0.0) {}

  @operator(">")
  protected __gt(other: Vec3): bool {
    return (
      this.x * this.x + this.y * this.y + this.z * this.z >
      other.x * other.x + other.y * other.y + other.z * other.z
    );
  }
}

// valid assertion because `@operator` was overloaded
expect<Vec3>(new Vec3(1, 2, 3)).toBeGreaterThan(new Vec3(0, 0, 0));
```

These methods are safe to use portably with `jest`, provided they aren't used
with reference types.

### toBeCloseTo Comparison

When doing floating point math, it's possible that values will not be exactly as
expected because of floating point error.

```ts
expect<f64>(0.1 + 0.2).toBe(0.3); // fails

> 0.1 + 0.2
0.30000000000000004
```

Instead, use `expect().toBeCloseTo()` to validate an expected floating point
value.

```ts
expect<f64>(0.1 + 0.2).toBeCloseTo(0.3); // passes!
```

Reference values and integer values will result in a runtime error, because
`toBeCloseTo` comparisons require a floating point number to work.

This method is safe to use portably with `jest`.

### toHaveLength Comparison

This comparison verifies the length of a given object. This includes Arrays,
TypedArrays, ArrayBuffers, and custom classes that have a `length` property.

```ts
class LengthExample {
  constructor(public length: i32 = 0) {}
}

const array = new Array<Vec3>(100);
const typedarray = new Uint8Array(42);
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(29);
const custom = new LengthExample(50);

expect<Array<Vec3>>(array).toHaveLength(100);
expect<Uint8Array>(typedarray).toHaveLength(42);
expect<ArrayBuffer>(buffer).toHaveLength(29);
expect<LengthExample>(custom).toHaveLength(50);
```

This method is safe to use with `jest`, with the exception of using
`ArrayBuffer`.

### toContain and toInclude Comparison

This comparison is used to determine if an Array contains a value.

All the values returned by `T[index]` will be compared using the `==` operator,
so overloading the class `@operator("==")` can be used in conjunction with this
comparison. The `index` must be a number value, and there must be a `length`
property that matches the `index` type. All values from `0` to `length - 1`
will be checked.

```ts
const data = new Uint8Array(100);
data[5] = 255;

expect<Uint8Array>(data).toContain(255);
```

This method is portable with `jest` using the `toContain()` method.

### toContainEqual and toIncludeEqual Comparison

This comparison is used to determine if an Array contains a reference that
equals another reference.

All the values returned by `T[index]` will be compared using the `==` operator,
and if that comparison does not work, a memcompare will be used. Overloading the
class `@operator("==")` can be used in conjunction with this comparison. The
`index` must be a number value, and there must be a `length` property that
matches the `index` type. All values from `0` to `length - 1` will be checked.

```ts
const reference = new Vec3(1, 2, 3);
const data = new Array<Vec3>(0);
data.push(new Vec(0, 0, 0));
data.push(new Vec(1, 2, 3));
data.push(new Vec(4, 5, 6));

expect<Uint8Array>(data).toContainEqual(referece);
```

This method is portable with `jest` using the `toContainEqual()` method.

## Types And Tooling

The `as-pect` core comes with a way to generate the types for all the globals
used by the framework. This will greatly increase your productivity because it
comes with lots of documentation, and adds a lot of intellisense to your
development experience.

It is also possible to reference the types manually. Use the following
reference at the top of your `assembly/index.ts` file to include these types
in your project automatically. If you use this method for your types, feel
free to delete the auto-generated types file in your test folder.

```ts
/// <reference path="../node_modules/@as-pect/core/types/as-pect.d.ts" />
/// <reference path="../node_modules/@as-pect/core/types/as-pect.portable.d.ts" />
```

## AssemblyScript Compiler Options

In order to compile the test binary correctly, the `@as-pect/core/assembly/index.ts`
file must be included as an entry point. Also, `--use ASC_RTRACE=1` must be used
in order to enable RTrace error reporting and reference counting statistics.
Finally, the `--explicitStart` flag must be passed to the compiler to enable
proper test name and group name collection since `as-pect` will call the
`wasm.__start()` method manually. This is absolutely required.

## Closures

AssemblyScript currently does not support closures around local scopes, only
around global scope. However, you can place all relevant tests and setup
function calls for a test suite into a corresponding `describe` block after
declaring a global variable.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```ts
import { Vec3 } from "./setup/Vec3";

// setup a global vector reference
var vec: Vec3;

describe("vectors", () => {
  // this runs before each test function, and must be placed within the describe function
  beforeEach(() => {
    // create a new vector for each test
    vec = new Vec3(1, 2, 3);
  });

  // this runs after each test function, and must be placed within the describe function
  afterEach(() => {
    vec = null; // free the vector
  });

  // use `test()` or `it()` to run a test
  test("vec should not be null", () => {
    // write an expectation
    expect<Vec3>(vec).not.toBeNull();
  });
});
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Nested `describe` blocks are supported and the outer describe should be
evaluated first.

```ts
describe("vector", () => {
  // this test block runs first
  it("should run first", () => {});

  describe("addition", () => {
    // this test block runs second
    it("should add vectors together", () => {
      expect<Vec3>(vec1.add(vec2)).toStrictEqual(new Vec3(1, 2, 3));
    });
  });
});
```

## Expectations

Calling the `expect<T>(value: T)` function outside of the following functions
will result in unexpected behavior:

- `beforeEach()`
- `afterEach()`
- `beforeAll()`
- `afterAll()`
- `test()`
- `it()`
- `throws()`
- `itThrows()`

If this happens, the entire test suite will fail before it runs in the CLI, and
the error description will be reported to the console.

## Logging

A global `log<T>(value: T): void` function is provided by `as-pect` to help
collect useful information about the state of your program. Simply give it
the type you want to log, and it will append a `LogValue` item to the
corresponding `TestResult` or `TestGroup` item the `log()` function was
called within.

```ts
log<string>("This will log a string"); // Remember, strings are references
log<f64>(0.4); // this logs a float value
log<i32>(42); // this logs the meaning of life
log<Vec3>(new Vec3(1, 2, 3)); // this logs every byte in the reference
log<i32[]>([1, 2, 3]); // this will log an array
```

This log function does _not_ pipe the output to stdout. It simply attaches the
log value to the current group or test the `log()` function was called in. Then
the after the test runs the configured `Reporter` decides if it is piped to
stdout, which is what `DefaultTestReporter` does.

## Reporters

Reporters are the way tests get reported. When running the CLI, the
`SummaryReporter` is used and all the values will be logged to the console. The
test suite itself does not log out test results. If you want to use a custom
reporter, you can create your own by extending the abstract `Reporter` class.

```ts
export abstract class Reporter {
  public abstract onStart(suite: TestSuite): void;
  public abstract onGroupStart(group: TestGroup): void;
  public abstract onGroupFinish(group: TestGroup): void;
  public abstract onTestStart(group: TestGroup, result: TestResult): void;
  public abstract onTestFinish(group: TestGroup, result: TestResult): void;
  public abstract onFinish(suite: TestSuite): void;
  public abstract onTodo(group: TestGroup, todo: string): void;
}
```

Each test suite run will use the provided reporter and call
`onStart(suite: TestSuite)` to notify a consumer that a test has started. This
happens once per test file. Since a file can have multiple `describe` function
calls, these are logically placed into `TestGroup`s. Each `TestGroup` has it's
own description and contains a list of `TestResult`s that were run.

If no reporter is provided to the configuration, one will be provided that uses
`stdout` and `chalk` to provide colored output.

If performance is enabled, then the `times` array will be populated with the
runtime values measured in milliseconds.

### SummaryReporter

This reporter only outputs failed tests and is the default `TestReporter` used
by the `as-pect` cli. It can be used directly from the configuration file.

```ts
const { SummaryReporter, TestContext } = require("@as-pect/core");

// create a test context
const ctx = new TestContext({
  reporter: new SummaryReporter({
    // enableLogging: false, // disable logging
  }),
});
```

### VerboseReporter

This reporter outputs a lot of information, including:

- All Test Groups and Test Names for each test
- RTrace Info (reference allocations vs deallocations)
- Performance Statistics
- Logging Information

```ts
const { VerboseReporter, TestContext } = require("@as-pect/core");

// create a test context
const ctx = new TestContext({
  reporter: new VerboseReporter(),
});
```

### JSONReporter

The `JSONReporter` can be used to create `json` files that contain the test
output. The file output location is `{testname}.spec.json`. It can be used
directly from the configuration file.

```ts
const { JSONReporter, TestContext } = require("@as-pect/core");

// export your configuration
const ctx = new TestContext({
  reporter: new JSONReporter(), // internally uses the fs.createWriteStream() function
});
```

The object ouput definition is shaped like this:

```ts
// Test Results are compiled into an array
[
  // For each test, there is an object with the following shape
  {
    // The Test Group
    group: group.name,
    // The Test Name
    name: result.name,
    // If it ran
    ran: result.ran,
    // If it passed
    pass: result.pass,
    // The total test runtim
    runtime: result.runTime,
    // The error message
    message: result.message,
    // Actual value message if an expectation failed
    actual: result.actual ? result.actual.message : null,
    // Expected value message if an expectation failed
    expected: result.expected ? result.expected.message : null,
    // The average run time (performance)
    average: result.average,
    // The median run time (performance)
    median: result.median,
    // The maximum run time (performance)
    max: result.max,
    // The minimum run time (performance)
    min: result.min,
    // The standard deviation of the run times (performance)
    stdDev: result.stdDev,
    // The variance of the run times (performance)
    variance: result.variance,
  },
];
```

### CSVReporter

The `CSVReporter` can be used to create `csv` files that contain the test
output. The file output location is `{testname}.spec.csv`. It can be used
directly from the configuration file.

```ts
const { CSVReporter, TestContext } = require("@as-pect/core");

// export your configuration
const ctx = new TestContext({
  reporter: new CSVReporter(), // internally uses the fs.createWriteStream() function
});
```

This is a list of all the columns in the exported csv file.

```ts
const csvColumns = [
  "Group", // The Test Group
  "Name", // The Test Name
  "Ran", // If it ran
  "Pass", // If it passed
  "Runtime", // The total test runtim
  "Message", // The error message
  "Actual", // Actual value message if an expectation failed
  "Expected", // Expected value message if an expectation failed
  "Average", // The average run time (performance)
  "Median", // The median run time (performance)
  "Max", // The maximum run time (performance)
  "Min", // The minimum run time (performance)
  "StdDev", // The standard deviation of the run times (performance)
  "Variance", // The variance of the run times (performance)
];
```

## Portability

It is possible to write `as-pect` tests that run in `jest` as well. The
compatible functions are documented in the
`@as-pect/core/types/as-pect.portable.d.ts` file and can be added to your
project by using the `--portable` flag. Instead of using the types provided by
`@types/jest`, use the portable ones provided by `as-pect`. This is the
recommended way to setup testing when trying to write portable tests.

```
npm install --save-dev jest @as-pect/cli typescript assemblyscript/assemblyscript
npx ts-jest config:init
npx asp --portable
```

Then change the jest configuration to match these properties as you see fit:

```js
module.exports = {
  preset: "ts-jest",
  testEnvironment: "node",
  testMatch: ["assembly/__tests__/**/*.spec.ts"],
};
```

This is the compatibility table.

## RTrace and Memory Leaks

If an expectation fails and hits an `unreachable()` instruction, any unreleased
references in the function call stack will be held indefinitely as a memory
leak. Test Suites don't stop running if they fail the test callback. However,
tests will stop if they fail inside the `beforeEach()`, `beforeAll()`,
`afterEach()`, and `afterAll()` callbacks.

Typically, a `throws()` test will leave at _least_ a single `Expectation` on the
heap. This is to be expected, because the `unreachable()` instruction unwinds
the stack, and prevents the ability for each function to `__release` a reference
pointer properly. Your test suite output may look like this:

```
[Describe]: toHaveLength TypedArray type: Uint32Array

 [Success]: ✔ should assert expected length
  [Throws]: ✔ when expected length should not equal the same value RTrace: +3
 [Success]: ✔ should verify the length is not another value
  [Throws]: ✔ when the length is another expected value RTrace: +3
```

The `RTrace: +3` corresponds to an `Expectation`, a `Uint32Array`, and a single
backing `ArrayBuffer` that was left on the heap because of the fact that the
expectation failed. This was expected because these two tests were annotated
with the `throws(desc, callback)` function. If you see a function that is
expected to `pass` and `RTrace` returns a very large value, it might be an
indicator of a very serious memory leak, and the `DefaultTestReporter` can be
your best friend when it comes to finding these sorts of problems.

Among other solutions, the following methods are exposed to you as a way to
inspect how many allocations and frees occurred during the course of function
execution. Every one of these functions exist in the `RTrace` namespace and will
call into JavaScript to query the state of the heap relative to the overall test
file, the test group, and each individual test depending on the function.

### RTrace.count()

The count method returns the current number of heap allocations.

Example:

```ts
const num: i32 = RTrace.count(); // The current number of allocations on the heap
```

### RTrace.start(label: i32)

The start method creates a starting point for a relative number of heap
allocations. It should be used in conjunction with the `RTrace.end(label)`
method which returns the relative number of heap allocations compared to the
starting number when the label was created.

Example:

```ts
const enum RTraceLabels {
  MEMORY_INTENSIVE_OPERATION = 0,
}

RTrace.start(RTraceLabels.MEMORY_INTENSIVE_OPERATION);
doSomething();
const end: i32 = RTrace.end(RTraceLabels.MEMORY_INTENSIVE_OPERATION);
expect<i32>(end).toBe(0);
```

### RTrace.end(label: i32)

The end method creates an ending point for a relative number of heap
allocations to be measured from. It should be used in conjunction with the
`RTrace.start(label)` method which returns the relative number of heap
allocations compared to the starting number when the label was created.

Example:

```ts
const enum RTraceLabels {
  MEMORY_INTENSIVE_OPERATION = 0,
}

RTrace.start(RTraceLabels.MEMORY_INTENSIVE_OPERATION);
doSomething();
const end: i32 = RTrace.end(RTraceLabels.MEMORY_INTENSIVE_OPERATION);
expect<i32>(end).toBe(0);
```

### RTrace.allocations()

The allocations function will report the exact number of allocations that have
occurred during the course of test file evaluation.

```ts
const allocations: i32 = RTrace.allocations();
```

### RTrace.frees()

The allocations function will report the exact number of frees that have
occurred during the course of test file evaluation.

```ts
const frees: i32 = RTrace.frees();
```

### RTrace.groupAllocations()

The allocations function will report the exact number of allocations that have
occurred during the course of the test group's evaluation.

```ts
describe("a group", () => {
  afterAll(() => {
    const groupAllocations: i32 = RTrace.groupAllocations();
  });
});
```

### RTrace.groupFrees()

The frees function will report the exact number of frees that have occurred
during the course of the test group's evaluation.

```ts
describe("a group", () => {
  afterAll(() => {
    const groupFrees: i32 = RTrace.groupFrees();
  });
});
```

### RTrace.testAllocations()

The allocations function will report the exact number of allocations that have
occurred during the course of the test's evaluation.

```ts
describe("a group", () => {
  afterEach(() => {
    const testAllocations: i32 = RTrace.testAllocations();
  });
});
```

### RTrace.testFrees()

The frees function will report the exact number of frees that have occurred
during the course of the test's evaluation.

```ts
describe("a group", () => {
  afterEach(() => {
    const testFrees: i32 = RTrace.testFrees();
  });
});
```

### RTrace.increments()

The increments function returns the total number of reference counted increments
that occurred over the course of the current test file.

Example:

```ts
const increments: i32 = RTrace.increments();
```

### RTrace.decrements()

The decrements function returns the total number of reference counted decrements
that occurred over the course of the current test file.

Example:

```ts
const decrements: i32 = RTrace.decrements();
```

### RTrace.groupIncrements()

The groupIncrements function returns the total number of reference counted
increments that occurred over the course of the current testing group.

```ts
describe("A testing group", () => {
  afterAll(() => {
    // log how many increments occured
    log<i32>(RTrace.groupIncrements());
  });
});
```

### RTrace.groupDecrements()

The groupDecrements function returns the total number of reference counted
decrements that occurred over the course of the current testing group.

```ts
describe("A testing group", () => {
  afterAll(() => {
    // log how many increments occured
    log<i32>(RTrace.groupDecrements());
  });
});
```

### RTrace.testIncrements()

The testIncrements function returns the total number of reference counted
increments that occurred over the course of the current testing group.

```ts
describe("A testing group", () => {
  afterEach(() => {
    // log how many increments occured
    log<i32>(RTrace.testIncrements());
  });
});
```

### RTrace.testDecrements()

The testDecrements function returns the total number of reference counted
decrements that occurred over the course of the current testing group.

```ts
describe("A testing group", () => {
  afterEach(() => {
    // log how many increments occured
    log<i32>(RTrace.testDecrements());
  });
});
```

### RTrace.collect()

This method triggers a garbage collection.

```ts
describe("something", () => {
  // put some tests here
});

afterEach(() => {
  // trigger a garbage collection after each test
  RTrace.collect();
});
```

## Performance Testing

To increase performance on testing, do not use the `log()` function and reduce
the amount of IO that `as-pect` must do to compile your tests. The biggest
bottleneck in Web Assembly testing, is compilation. This means that using
things like `@inline` many times will cause your module to compile more slowly,
and as a result the test file will run slower.

### Performance Enabling Via API

To enable performance using the global test functions, call the
`Performance.enabled()` function with a `true` value.

```ts
describe("my test suite", () => {
  Performance.enabled(true);
  test("some performance test", () => {
    // some performance sensitive code
  });
});
```

When using `Performance.enabled(true)` on a test, logs are not supported for
that specific test. Running 10000 samples of a function that collects logs
will result in a very large amount of memory usage and IO. Calls to `log<T>()`
will be ignored and any test with the `test.performance` property set to
`true` will have a `test.logs` array with a length of `0`.

Note that each of the performance functions must be called before the test is
declared in the same `describe` block to override the corresponding default
configuration values on a test by test basis.

To override the maximum number of samples collected, use the
`Performance.maxSamples` function.

```ts
Performance.maxSamples(10000); // 10000 is the maximum value
it("should collect only 10000 samples at most", () => {});
```

To override the maximum test run time (including test logic), use the
`Performance.maxRunTime` function.

```ts
Performance.maxRunTime(5000); // 5000 ms, or 5 seconds of test run time
it("should have a maxRunTime of 5 seconds", () => {});
```

To override how many decimal places are rounded to, use the
`Performance.roundDecimalPlaces` function.

```ts
Performance.roundDecimalPlaces(4); // 3 is the default
it("should round to 4 decimal places", () => {});
```

To force reporting of the median test runtime, use the
`Performance.reportMedian` function.

```ts
Performance.reportMedian(true); // false will disable reporting of the median
it("should report the median", () => {});
```

To force reporting of the average, or mean test runtime, use the
`Performance.reportAverage` function.

```ts
Performance.reportAverage(true); // false will disable reporting of the mean
it("should report the average", () => {});
```

To force reporting of the variance of the runtimes, use the
`Performance.reportVariance` function.

```ts
// false will disable reporting of the variance
Performance.reportVariance(true);
it("should report the variance deviation", () => {});
```

To force reporting of the standard deviation of the runtimes, use the
`Performance.reportStdDev` function. This method implies the use of a variance
calculation, and will be auto-included in the test result.

```ts
// false will disable reporting of the standard deviation
Performance.reportStdDev(true);
it("should report the standard deviation", () => {});
```

To force reporting of the maximum runTime value, use the
`Performance.reportMax` function.

```ts
Performance.reportMax(true); // false will disable reporting of the max
it("should report the max", () => {});
```

To force reporting of the minimum runTime value, use the
`Performance.reportMin` function.

```ts
Performance.reportMin(true); // false will disable reporting of the min
it("should report the min", () => {});
```

## Performance Enabling Via Configuration

Providing these values inside an `as-pect.config.js` configuration will set
these as _the_ global defaults.

Note that when using the `cli`, the cli flag inputs will override the
`as-pect.config.js` configured values.

```js
// in as-pect.config.js
module.exports = {
  performance: {
    /** Enable performance statistics gathering for *every* test. */
    enabled: false,
    /** Set the maximum number of samples to run for every test. */
    maxSamples: 10000,
    /** Set the maximum test run time in milliseconds for every test. */
    maxTestRunTime: 2000,
    /** Report the median time in the default reporter for every test. */
    reportMedian: true,
    /** Report the average time in milliseconds for every test. */
    reportAverage: true,
    /** Report the standard deviation for every test. */
    reportStandardDeviation: false,
    /** Report the maximum run time in milliseconds for every test. */
    reportMax: false,
    /** Report the minimum run time in milliseconds for every test. */
    reportMin: false,
  },
};
```

## Custom Imports Using CLI

If a set of custom imports are required for your test module, it's possible to
provide a set of imports for a given test file.

If your test is located at `assembly/__tests__/customImports.spec.ts`, then use
filename `assembly/__tests__/customImports.spec.imports.js` to export the test
module's imports. This file will be required by the cli before the module is
instantiated.

_**IMPORTANT**: THIS WILL IGNORE `as-pect.config.js`'S IMPORTS COMPLETELY_

Please see the provided example located in `assembly/__tests__/customImports.spec.ts`.

## Using as-pect as a Package

It's possible that running your tests requires a browser environment. Instead
of running `as-pect` from the command line, use the `--output-binary` flag
along with the `--norun` flag and this will cause `as-pect` to output the
`*.spec.wasm` file. This binary can be `fetch()`ed and instantiate like the
following example.

```ts
// browser-test.ts
import { instantiateBuffer } from "assemblyscript/lib/loader";
import {
  TestContext,
  IPerformanceConfiguration,
  IAspectExports,
  // EmptyReporter,
} from "as-pect";

const performanceConfiguration: IPerformanceConfiguration = {
  // put performance configuration values here
};

// Create a TestContext
const runner = new TestContext({
  // reporter: new EmptyReporter(), // Use this to override default test reporting
  performanceConfiguration,
  // testRegex: /.*/, // Use this to run only tests that match this regex
  // groupRegex: /.*/, // Use this to run only groups that match this regex
  fileName: "./test.spec.ts", // Always set the filename
});

// put your assemblyscript imports here
const imports = runner.createImports({});

// instantiate your test module here via the "assemblyscript/lib/loader" module
const wasm = instantiateStreaming<IAspectExports>(
  fetch("./test.spec.wasm"),
  imports,
);

runner.run(wasm); // run the tests synchronously

// loop over each group and test in that group
for (const group of runner.testGroups) {
  for (const test of group.tests) {
    console.log(test.name, test.pass ? "pass" : "fail");
  }
}
```

If you want to compile each test suite manually, it's possible to use the `asc`
compiler yourself by including the following file in your compilation.

```
./node_modules/as-pect/assembly/index.ts
```

By default, `as-pect` always shows the generated compiler flags.
